# PGR API
A repository dedicated to storing information on every playable construct within game to provide a thorough backend API usable for various community applications: such as the community wiki.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to deliver a back-end application that aggregates information from the mobile game Punishing: Gray Raven (shortened to PGR).

This project was created using a culmination of my front-end and back-end skills. I started by creating a back-end application with JavaScript, Node.js and Express which contained an array of objects consisting of the entire roster within PGR. I then utilized Express to deliver JSON files upon HTML requests to this specific site.
Afterwards I created a simple, effective page to convey the data contained within my API so that others may use it.

## Optimizations

Given more time I plan on adding a "testing ground" to allow individuals to call objects within my site page to test this API. I would also like to add image data extracted from within the game so that users can have access to official models and art featuring the roster within this game.

## Lessons Learned:

This project allowed me to utilize my entire full-stack skillset in order to create an application with widespread use that can benefit a larger community. I was able to create a database of information using JavaScript, Node.js, Express and convey accurate documentation on how to use this application using HTML and CSS.
